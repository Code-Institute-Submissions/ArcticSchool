      "about": "He is our the youngest crew member who become an instructor just few years ago. Previously he was working as a snowboards desk maker for his father's company. Funny thing is, when he was 16 he said: 'I will never become a snowboarder, it's to hard..'. Know he is fully trained, very skilled snowboard trainer in our school. His life make a 180 degress turn from, not believing in himself to training people who have same attitude as he had many years ago. As you can see nothing is impossilbe so let's get on snowboard desks and ride down  on our slopes."
