## UX

### User Goals

### User Stories

#### Common User Stories

#### New Users

#### Returning Users

### Site Owner Goals

* To have a well design, with easy to use interface so the clients will not feel frustraied when using they're using website.
* To receive email from website users/customers when they fill out online contact form, so I can replay on their queries
* To have possibility to Add, Edit and Delete products/lessons.
* To be able to provide secure payment method/service for my clients/website users.
* To have a secure admin interface, easy to use. Important thing is, this interface must be available only for admins.

### User Requirements and Expectations

### Wireframes

To create wireframes I've used [Axure RP9](https://www.axure.com) software.
If you don't want to buy the software, you can use the 30 days free trail version (Exactly like I did).

To veiw all wireframes for this project please use this link - 
[Arctic School Wireframes](https://2u83gc.axshare.com) \
Please use side navigation to view all wireframes and interactive connections.

__*Note:*__ To create this project I am fighting with myself to decide which style will suit this project the most. That's why, I belive some wireframes may change through the development process and several improvements can have place, such as buttons style, images position, text style or user small user interface changes.
