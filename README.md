## Design

### Logotype

I've used [Provicali](https://www.dafont.com/provicali.font) to create a logotype.
To create mountian effect inside logotype font I've used image from []().

### Colors

Whole application coloristic was selected based on the projecet name and my personal style of design. Name **Arcitc** will always reminds us winter and cold climate. That's why I've decided to use two main colors: white and blue. I've also used different additonals tones of blue color to accent different elements of page. To break white and blue colors I've used black and tones of black colour.

After testing different coloristic to break out the blues and whites, I've decided to add another color: red.
Red will stand out and notify customer about something important on the page, something they should look at.

To create colour pallet I've used [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co) - super fast color schemes generator!

If you want to copy my colour pallet scheme, pelase use this link [ArcticSchoolColors](https://coolors.co/ffffff-9deefb-00d4f5-31addf-1ca5dc-059cd9-000000)

### Fonts

In this project I've decied to use two different fonts.
Fonts have been selected carefully to separate main titles from contet text. This should help user read the smaller text on different type of devices

As a main title and subtitle font I've used -
[Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?thickness=7&preview.text=&preview.text_type=custom&query=Montserrat) font. \
For other text I've used - [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?thickness=7&preview.text=&preview.text_type=custom&query=Lato) font.

### Icons

I've used different type, shapes and style of icons in this project to separate important elements from main content. Part of my icons are static files which you can download by registering on [icons8](https://icons8.com/icons). \
I have also used a [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) for handy and most common icons.

### Framework

From the first time when I've started to using [jQuery](https://jquery.com), I just felt in love with this JavaScript Library designed to simplify tree traversal and manipulation. By using it I've created lots of different mouse events, css animiation and other very nice looking features. Because of jQuery I believe user interraction with the page is on the next level. This is making my project more attractive for users and make their experience better.

I have used [Bootstrap v4.5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) to build quickly desinged and customized responsive application with mobile-first approach. Bootstrap is providing sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system which hepled me create nice pages layout and structure. I've used components to create navbar, cards, forms etc.

### Wireframes

To create wireframes I've used [Axure RP9](https://www.axure.com) software.
If you don't want to buy the software, you can use the 30 days free trail version (Exactly like I did).

To veiw all wireframes for this project please use this link -
[Arctic School Wireframes](https://2u83gc.axshare.com) \
Please use side navigation to view all wireframes and interactive connections.

__*Note:*__ To create this project I am fighting with myself to decide which style will suit this project the most. That's why, I belive some wireframes may change through the development process and several improvements can have place, such as buttons style, images position, text style or user small user interface changes.

## Bugs

#### Bugs During Development:

During development of this project I've faced my lack of knowledge and lots of challenging issues that makes my life 10000 times harder then it actually was.. Most of the solutions were so simply that I couldn't believe in it.

Verdict? Don't waist your time trying re-invent the wheel. Take a small break and try to release all the stress and bad thinking. Ask for advice, don't be afriad to do it. There is plenty of people with bigger knowledge and great, great solutions!


Django-responsive2
- <strong>Bug</strong>: Issues with setting up django-responsive2, show different navigation bar on different device size.
- <strong>Fix</strong>: Removed all django-responsive2 code and information. I've asked Code Institute - Tutors section for help/solution, advice given : try to use Bootstrap breakpoints and classes instead of django-responsive2. \
  Display classes applied to index.html header code.
- <strong>Verdict</strong>: Result as expected. Different navigation bars presented on different device size.

Navigation Hamburger Button
- <strong>Bug</strong>: Navigation hamburger button not working on medium devices.
- <strong>Fix</strong>: Different ID selector added to medium size / tablet nav bar, script.js function extended.
- <strong>Verdict</strong>: Hamburger button anmiation working as expected.

Social Media Icons
- <strong>Bug</strong>: Social media style seems to be incorect after moving social media icons code snippet to speparate html file/includes.
- <strong>Fix</strong>: CSS classes adapted to match previous stlye.
- <strong>Verdict</strong>: Social media icons section presented in the same way, as before moving code to outside html file. Social-media-set.html file can be used as includes when building homepnage.

Fixture and migrations issue
- <strong>Bug</strong>: Python3 manage.py loaddata fiel.json command not working and showin the error message. I couldn't make a migrations properly.
- <strong>Fix</strong>: Command found on []() \
    python manage.py migrate --run-syn
- <strong>Verdict</strong>: Database synchronized, all unmigrated migrations applied. Fixtures loaded. Working as expected. Beautifully !
