## Design

### Colors

Whole application coloristic was selected based on the projecet name and my personal style of design. Name **Arcitc** will always reminds us winter and cold climate. That's why I've decided to use two main colors: white and blue. I've also used different additonals tones of blue color to accent different elements of page. To break white and blue colors I've used black and tones of black colour.

To create colour pallet I've used [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co) - super fast color schemes generator!

If you want to copy my colour pallet scheme, pelase use this link [ArcticSchoolColors](https://coolors.co/ffffff-9deefb-00d4f5-31addf-1ca5dc-059cd9-000000)

<img src="https://www.abovewave.kylos.pl/ArcticSchool/ArcticSchoolCoolors.png" style="widt:100%;" alt="Arctic School Coloristic">

### Fonts

In this project I've decied to use two different fonts.
Fonts have been selected carefully to separate main titles from contet text. This should help user read the smaller text on different type of devices

As a main title and subtitle font I've used -
[Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?thickness=7&preview.text=&preview.text_type=custom&query=Montserrat) font. \
For other text I've used - [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?thickness=7&preview.text=&preview.text_type=custom&query=Lato) font.

### Icons

I've used different type, shapes and style of icons in this project to separate important elements from main content. Part of my icons are static files which you can download by registering on [icons8](https://icons8.com/icons). \
I have also used a [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) for handy and most common icons.

### Structures

### Database Structure

### Wireframes

To create wireframes I've used [Axure RP9](https://www.axure.com) software.
If you don't want to buy the software, you can use the 30 days free trail version (Exactly like I did).

To veiw all wireframes for this project please use this link -
[Arctic School Wireframes](https://2u83gc.axshare.com) \
Please use side navigation to view all wireframes and interactive connections.

__*Note:*__ To create this project I am fighting with myself to decide which style will suit this project the most. That's why, I belive some wireframes may change through the development process and several improvements can have place, such as buttons style, images position, text style or user small user interface changes.

## Technologies Used

### Languages

### Libraries and Frameworks

From the first time when I've started to using [jQuery](https://jquery.com), I just felt in love with this JavaScript Library designed to simplify tree traversal and manipulation. By using it I've created lots of different mouse events, css animiation and other very nice looking features. Because of jQuery I believe user interraction with the page is on the next level. This is making my project more attractive for users and make their experience better.

I have used [Bootstrap v4.5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) to build quickly desinged and customized responsive application with mobile-first approach. Bootstrap is providing sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system which hepled me create nice pages layout and structure. I've used components to create navbar, cards, forms etc.
