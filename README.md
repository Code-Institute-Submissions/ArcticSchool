## Design

### Logotype

I've used [Provicali](https://www.dafont.com/provicali.font) to create a logotype..

### Colors

Whole application coloristic was selected based on the projecet name and my personal style of design. Name **Arcitc** will always reminds us winter and cold climate. That's why I've decided to use two main colors: white and blue. I've also used different additonals tones of blue color to accent different elements of page. To break white and blue colors I've used black and tones of black colour.

After testing different coloristic to break out the blues and whites, I've decided to add another color: red.
Red will stand out and notify customer about something important on the page, something they should look at.

To create colour pallet I've used [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co) - super fast color schemes generator!

If you want to copy my colour pallet scheme, pelase use this link [ArcticSchoolColors](https://coolors.co/ffffff-9deefb-00d4f5-31addf-1ca5dc-059cd9-000000)

<img src="https://www.abovewave.kylos.pl/ArcticSchool/Arcitic_Coloristic.png" style="widt:100%;" alt="Arctic School Coloristic">

### Fonts

In this project I've decied to use two different fonts.
Fonts have been selected carefully to separate main titles from contet text. This should help user read the smaller text on different type of devices

As a main title and subtitle font I've used -
[Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?thickness=7&preview.text=&preview.text_type=custom&query=Montserrat) font. \
For other text I've used - [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?thickness=7&preview.text=&preview.text_type=custom&query=Lato) font.

### Icons

I've used different type, shapes and style of icons in this project to separate important elements from main content. Part of my icons are static files which you can download by registering on [icons8](https://icons8.com/icons). \
I have also used a [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) for handy and most common icons.

### Framework

From the first time when I've started to using [jQuery](https://jquery.com), I just felt in love with this JavaScript Library designed to simplify tree traversal and manipulation. By using it I've created lots of different mouse events, css animiation and other very nice looking features. Because of jQuery I believe user interraction with the page is on the next level. This is making my project more attractive for users and make their experience better.

I have used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) to build quickly desinged and customized responsive application with mobile-first approach. Bootstrap is providing sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system which hepled me create nice pages layout and structure. I've used components to create navbar, cards, forms etc.

### Wireframes

To create wireframes I've used [Axure RP9](https://www.axure.com) software.
If you don't want to buy the software, you can use the 30 days free trail version (Exactly like I did).

To veiw all wireframes for this project please use this link -
[Arctic School Wireframes](https://github.com/KarolSliwka/ArcticSchool/tree/main/wireframes)

__*Note:*__ To create this project I am fighting with myself to decide which style will suit this project the most. That's why, I belive some wireframes may change through the development process and several improvements can have place, such as buttons style, images position, text style or user small user interface changes.

## Information Architecture

### Database choice

During the development I worked with **sqlite3** databases, installed with Django.
For production I've used a **PostgreSQL** database which is provided in Heroku as add-on.

- The **User model** I have used in this project was provided by Django Allauth. It is a part of default `django.contrib.auth.models`.

## Features

Arctic School Web App contains 8 applications `home`, `lessons`(contains lessons to book), `team`, `resorts`, `booking`, `checkout`, `contact` and `profiles`(contains booking active and archived history + Management/Administartion Pages).

### Features Left to Implement

There are some features that I considered were of secondary importance and I have not implemented them yet due to time constraints, but intend to do so in future when I will be able to dedicate more time to them. Most of these features are displayed in my [original wireframes](https://github.com/irinatu17/Art-of-Tea/tree/master/wireframes).

#### Social account login (Google and Facebook)

This feature allows users to login by using their social account. This will changed user experience and make the login process easy and simple.

#### Subscribing Newsletter Form

Newsletter form is only a visual prototype. It hasn't got a real action to sign customers for a newsletter.
All customers are singed autmatically to subscribing newsletter when registering.
This will allow users to subscribe without creating account on webiste.

Other small features are going to be implemented in feature, **Filtering Lessons** by Level, **Real Time Chat** also I would like to change **Management/Adminstartion Pages** style and **Forms** usability.

## Bugs

### Bugs During Development:

During development of this project I've faced my lack of knowledge and lots of challenging issues that makes my life 10000 times harder then it actually was.. Most of the solutions were so simply that I couldn't believe in it.

Verdict? Don't waist your time trying re-invent the wheel. Take a small break and try to release all the stress and bad thinking. Ask for advice, don't be afriad to do it. There is plenty of people with bigger knowledge and great, great solutions!
