### Wireframes

To create wireframes I've used [Axure RP9](https://www.axure.com) software.
If you don't want to buy the software, you can use the 30 days free trail version (Exactly like I did).

To veiw all wireframes for this project please use this link -
[Arctic School Wireframes](https://2u83gc.axshare.com) \
Please use side navigation to view all wireframes and interactive connections.

__*Note:*__ To create this project I am fighting with myself to decide which style will suit this project the most. That's why, I belive some wireframes may change through the development process and several improvements can have place, such as buttons style, images position, text style or user small user interface changes.
