## Validators

### HTML

All the HTML files were validated by using online code validator [W3C HTML Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org).
Errors found were about IMG 'hegiht, width' attributes missing. Wrong code scope by using UL and DIV's, also duplicated ID's were found.
Code was checked and all errors and warning were corrected, code is valid with no errors and warnings on all pages.

### CSS

All the SCSS and Main.min.css file were validated by using online code validator [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator).
There were several errors and warning found. There are warnings for colors contrast according to background that can be ignored.
Also there are warnings about -webkit- as validator is catching it as 'an unknown vendor extension'.

### JavaScript

All the Java Script files were validated by using online code validator [Beautifytools.com](http://beautifytools.com/javascript-validator.php).
Missing semicolons were added at the end of functions. 'Const' and 'Let' warning can be ingored.
Validator is showing message 'is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).' all Const's and Let's will be converted to Var's by browser.
Code is syntactically valid.
For more information about Const, Let and Future JS you can use [BabelJS](https://babeljs.io)

### Python

All Python files were validated by using online code validator [Pep8](http://pep8online.com).
File changes were made to make the code PEP8 compliant where possible.

### Debug = True

While developing app, local debugger: `debug=True` was on.
Everytime when application has an error, debugger was displaying error message page.
Thanks to that I could catch all errors and fix them staright away.

## Compatibility and Responsiveness

This website had been being tested during the development on Safari Browser by Web Development Tools.

Mostly I've used Web Inspector and Responsive Design Mode to preview different webpages across various screen sizes, orientations, and resolutions, as well as custom viewports and user agents.

It also been tested on different browsers such as: Google Chrome or Mozzila FireFox.

I have used powerfull online screen resizer and resposnivness tester [BlueTree Screenfly](https://bluetree.ai/screenfly/) Strongly recommended for everyone who want's easly test responsivity
